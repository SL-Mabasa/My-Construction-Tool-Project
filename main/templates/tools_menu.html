                                  <p> Omissions and Claims: I recently received a request for advice from one of our course attendees. It related to the Bill of Quantities and later drawing issues. This topic has arisen on several occasions so I thought it worthy of a blog. The situation and query was as follows:

                                    The Contract is a lump sum and not subject to re-measurement. The Bill of Quantities (BoQ) was prepared by the Contractor at the tender stage.
                                    
                                    During the course of project closure, some items listed in the BoQ were omitted. This is because the items were not included on tender drawings, shop drawing or final as-built drawings.
                                    
                                    However, the Client deducted these items as an omission at final account stage. They stated this was because the Contractor did not complete any of these billed works. The Contractor disagrees with this and asserts that he took the risk on the lump sum contract and the Bill of Quantities was merely for guidance and valuation only.</p>

                                  <p> A bill of quantities, or BoQ or simply BQ, is like a detailed shopping list for a construction project. Imagine youâ€™re building a house and you need to know exactly how much of each material such as bricks, cement, and wood you will need. The BoQ does just that. It lists how much of each item is required for the project.

                                    A bill of quantities is put together by a construction professional called a quantity surveyor. To create it, they need to know exactly what the building will look like and what materials will be used. Bills of quantities are mostly used for big construction projects. In the case of smaller projects or renovations, you might not need a BoQ.</p>
